Welcome to PAsampling's documentation!
==========================================================

This is a project founded by the `Rhine-Ruhr Center for Scientific Data Literacy <https://www.dkz2r.de/>`_ (DKZ.2R), which is one of the eleven Data Literacy Centers in Germany. The goal of DKZ.2R is to reduce data-related hurdles in research, train and support researchers in methodological data literacy in a holistic way, and promote data-competent scientists.

Overview
--------

Passive Sampling (PAsampling) is a repository designed to provide easy and fast access to existing and novel tools and resources for data sampling. This project aims to facilitate the implementation of data sampling techniques and provide insights on key aspects of data selection in machine learning, with a particular focus on training data selection for optimizing regression model performance. The term "Passive" refers to the fact that the library mainly focuses on selection approaches that rely solely on data feature representations and do not involve any active learning procedures, which require iterative learning of one or several models. Additionally, the library provides tools for creating machine learning experiment pipelines.
